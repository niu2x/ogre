# New and Noteworthy in OGRE 1.11

This is only a high level overview. For a detailed changes, see the git changelog.

## Core changes

Ogre now requires a C++11 conforming compiler (at least gcc 4.8 or VS2013). Furthermore internal headers were moved into the src/ directory and are not installed any more when creating the SDK. This prevents you from accidentally using private API, while giving us more flexibility to change the implementation.

* C++11ifycation: replace core classes by C++11 equivalents - particularly
  - SharedPtr -> `std::shared_ptr`. Note that due to its widespread usage, a SharedPtr wrapper class still exists for backwards compatibility.
  - AtomicScalar -> `std::atomic`
  - OGRE_HashMap -> `std::unordered_map`
  - _StringHash -> `std::hash< string >`
  - Timer: the platform specific implementations were replaced by wrapping 
  `std::chrono`.

* Removed container indirections. `Ogre::vector<int>::type`, is now just plain `std::vector<int>`. The Ogre version is still there to ease porting, but will generate a deprecation warning.

* Added strong typed `Affine3` matrix class.
  - overloads of `operator*`: no need to remember to call `transformAffine`, `concatenateAffine` etc. any more - everything is done and checked by the compiler automatically.
  - affine only methods moved from `Matrix4` to `Affine3`. e.g. `decomposition`, `getTrans`.
  - scale related functions moved from `Matrix4` to `Matrix3`: porting `.hasScale()` &rarr;  `.linear().hasScale()`
  - similarly `transformDirectionAffine` is now done by extracting the linear part via `linear()` and using `operator*` of `Matrix3`, that has now improved performance.

* Textures must not be declared in an Ogre Script *and* be manually created. Ogre now immediately creates all Textures declared in scripts (in unloaded state). Previously it was possible to declare a texture name in the Material and create a manual texture before the material was fully loaded. This is not possible any more.
If you were relying on the old behaviour, you now must explicitly set you manual texture via `->getTextureUnitState(..)->setTexture(manualTex)`.

* Reduced Memory consumption of core classes
  - by reducing padding and using bitfields for boolean flags, the memory consumption of e.g. `Pass` could be reduced by 11%.
  - see https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre/pull/665 for numbers of other classes

* Memory Allocation cleanup
    * Drop MemoryTracker API. Nowadays [MSan](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/MemorySanitizer) is the better alternative.
    * drop builtin support for custom memory allocators. Consequently drop nedmalloc. Was only needed on WinXP. Empty class definitions are still there for compatibility. If you still want a different allocator you have to [do so globally](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new#Global_replacements).

* default Light direction changed from `UNIT_Z` to `NEGATIVE_UNIT_Z` to be consistent with Cameras and SceneNodes. This will only cause issues if you were relying on the default direction. If you manually set it directly or via SceneNodes the results are the same. For legacy code with Lights attached to SceneNodes, just drop the `localDirectionVector` param.

* Generic Image codecs (STB Image, FreeImage) are now plugins. For distribution you should use compressed textures (e.g. DDS) with precomputed mipmaps. Having the generic codecs as plugins allows you to easily disable them. Editing software on the other hand can now easily swap in a custom implementation (like QImage).

* Mesh: does not use CPU shadow buffers by default any more. If you were relying on fast read access, you will have to explicitly request shadow buffers. Everybody else just saves memory now.

* `PF_DEPTH` now correctly works with `TU_RENDERTARGET`. This will create a depth-only FBO and give you the raw depth values, without needing any special shaders.

* New `SceneLoaderManager` API
  * you can now register classes derived from `SceneLoader`
  * calling `SceneLoaderManager::load("filename.ext", "Group", rootNode)` will then dispatch to a Loader supporting ".ext" (if available) and populate the given SceneManager starting at `rootNode`.

* Precompiled Headers (PCH) are now used on GCC too.
  * PCHs are the predecessors of the Module TS (C++20)
  * The PCH support in Ogre was rewritten to properly take advantage of this concept
  * they are used on both MSVC and GCC, where they speed up the build by about 2x
  * Consequently Unity build (rather hack) was dropped

* drop Threading backport from 2.x, `std::thread` is now the preferred API.
* drop unused ErrorDialog API
* drop RenderSystemCapabilities that were never set or that are supported everywhere

* `Archive` specializations e.g. `FileSystemArchive`, `ZipArchive` are now fully hidden. You must now use the respective Factories to create them.
* `WindowEventUtilities` were moved to the Bites Component. They rely on low level platform code (like X11 on linux) and are mostly obsoleted by the ApplicationContext class. Generally you should be using SDL2/ Qt for windowing and just embed Ogre instead.
* SceneManager: factored out SkyRenderer and ShadowRenderer helper classes. They enforce encapsulation and allow easier maintenance of the respective algorithms. In future this will be pluggable to allow for more sophisticated algorithms.


## Platforms
All platform headers were hidden and are now only available for internal usage. You are forced to use the cross platform API now. Alongside support for some obsolete platforms was dropped.
* Android: Android specific classes are now declared in the respective Main headers. e.g. APKZipArchive is in `OgreZip.h`
* iOS/ OSX: `macUtils.h` is hidden. Use the cross-platform alternatives in `FileSystemLayer` e.g. 
   - `iOSDocumentsDirectory()` -> `getWritablePath`
   - `macBundlePath()` -> `resolveBundlePath`
* drop Google NaCl platform support. [See the official migration guide](https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/migration)

## Overlay
Overlay scripts now support the standard ogrescript syntax and the `template` keyword is now optional. 
Furthermore the the `overlay_element` keyword unifies `container` and `element`, as there was little difference between those two.
So if you had a script like this

```cpp
template container BorderPanel(MyTemplates/BasicBorderPanel)
{
  ...
}

MyOverlays/AnotherOverlay
{
    zorder 490
    container BorderPanel(MyElements/BackPanel) : MyTemplates/BasicBorderPanel
    {
      ...
    }
}
```

you can (and should) now write

```cpp
overlay_element MyTemplates/BasicBorderPanel BorderPanel
{
  ...
}

overlay MyOverlays/AnotherOverlay
{
    zorder 490
    overlay_element MyElements/BackPanel BorderPanel : MyTemplates/BasicBorderPanel
    {
      ...
    }
}
```

in a later release the custom parser will be replaced by a standard ScriptTranslator. However to retain support for the old syntax it is kept for now. Consequently this means that script variables and abstract objects are not yet supported.

## BSP Plugin
* ported to the new `SceneLoader` API. Consequently `BspResourceManager` was replaced by `BspSceneLoader`.

## RenderSystems
* GL: bump required OpenGL version to 1.5 (Hardware from 2003)
* GL: no longer depends on GLU (deprecated since 2009)
* GLES1: dropped GLES1 RenderSystem (deprecated since 1.8)

## Bites
* SDL2 classes are no longer exported through headers.
  * OgreBites SDLK_.. enum moved into the `OgreBites` namespace. Internal SDL2 fields no longer accessible.
* While the API still resembles SDL2, we can now swap the implementation to e.g. Qt without API breaks.
* This finalizes Bites and allows to drop the BETA status

## Samples
Build all included samples as on SamplePlugin "DefaultSamples". This greatly simplifies the build and reduces build time while external Plugins are still supported.
